1. To create a new repository
  git init

2. To add files to the current repository
  git add filename1
  git add filename2 filename3
  git commit -m "modification you did"

3. To check the status of the current repository
  git status

4. To check the modification you did to the repository
  git log

5. To check the difference you did to the repository (this should be used before add)
  git diff

6. To go back to a specific version
  git reset --hard HEAD^
  or
  git reset --hard HEAD-1
  or
  git reset --hard <commit id>

7. To check the commit id of every modification you made
  git reflog

8. The concept of working directory, repository and stage
   When you are modifying a file, you are making modifications in working directory. To add it to the repository, you should first use command "git add filename" to add the file in the stage, than submit the changes in the stage to the repository using command "git commit".

9. To revoke the modification done in working directory
  git checkout -- filename
  ###: This command is actually replacing the file in working directory with the file in repository and applies to two situations
       a. If the file has not been added to the stage, the file will go back to the same as that in the repository.
       b. If the file has been added to the stage, but was modified afterwards, the file will go back to the same as that in the stage.

10. To revoke the modification added to the stage
  git reset HEAD filename
  ###: This command simply make the situation go back to item 9.

11. To delete a file from repository
  git rm filename
  git commit -m "comment"

12. Use ssh key to protect your repository. Nobody else can write it but it can be read by public.
